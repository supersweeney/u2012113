  <p>In a world where the planet is dying people are always looking for new days to help the planet and the environment. Many people do not realise that one of the key ways of doing this is preventing the sheer amount of energy they use in their day to day lives. It is common for people to waste electricty all the time. This can be from simple things like leaving devices on in stanby mode, not turning electronics off at the plug or perhaps even leaving lights on. This website's goal is to make people more aware of the implications of leaving their lights turned on when not needed, but also to inform the public of what energy saving bulbs are and how they can help both the consumer and the environment.</p>
